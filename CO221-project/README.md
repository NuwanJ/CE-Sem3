# CO221 Digital Design

Design an 4bit ALU using Combinantional Logic to obtain following operations.

| Control Input                | Operation                         
|-|-|
000 |  2's complement of A
001 |  2's complement of B
010 |  A + B
011 |  A - B
100 |  Bitwise A and B
101 |  Bitwise A or B
110 |  A x B
111 |  Any one (We selected A mod B ??)
